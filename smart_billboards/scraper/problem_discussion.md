**Q:** I need to build an AI agent. Said agent will scrape the web for the optimal time to show an ad based on parameters entered by a user (number of eyeballs, nature of product, category of product, age, sex, income level etc). Agent will return the time of day to an API and said API will update a smart billboard.


**A:** To build your AI agent that scrapes the web to determine the optimal time to show an ad based on user parameters (eyeballs, product nature, category, age, sex, income, etc.), consider the following approach:

Data Collection via AI-Powered Web Scraping:
Use an AI web scraping tool like ScrapeGraphAI or Gumloop that supports natural language prompts and can handle JavaScript-rendered pages to extract relevant data such as user activity patterns, competitor ad timings, and demographic engagement from multiple sources.

Parameter-Driven Scraping:
Configure the agent to target specific websites, social media, and ad platforms where data about audience behaviour and ad performance is available, filtering by your input parameters to gather precise insights.

Data Processing and Analysis:
Integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) or custom analytics to summarise and interpret the scraped data, identifying peak engagement times for the specified demographics and product categories.

API Integration:
Develop an API endpoint that receives the analysed output—the optimal ad display time—and updates the smart billboard system in real time for dynamic ad scheduling.

Robustness and Adaptability:
Implement proxy rotation, CAPTCHA bypass techniques, and JavaScript rendering to ensure the agent can scrape reliably across diverse and protected sites.

This setup leverages AI agents’ ability to automate complex scraping workflows, adapt to changing web structures, and provide actionable insights tailored to user-defined parameters, enabling your smart billboard to display ads at the most effective times

**Q:** How does the system design look like?
**A:** A robust system design for your AI agent to determine the optimal ad display time involves several key components working together in a modular, scalable architecture:

Component	Description
User Interface/API	Receives user parameters (eyeballs, product nature, category, demographics) and sends requests to the backend.
Scraping Orchestrator	Manages crawling tasks, schedules scraping jobs, and handles proxy rotation and headless browsers to avoid blocks.
AI-Powered Scraper	Uses NLP, computer vision, and ML models to extract and interpret dynamic web data, adapting to site changes and anti-bot measures.
Data Processing & Analytics	Cleans, normalises and analyses scraped data to identify peak engagement times based on input parameters, using ML or statistical models.
Decision Engine	Combines data insights to determine the optimal ad timing tailored to user criteria.
API Endpoint	Exposes the recommended time of day to external systems, such as the smart billboard controller.
Smart Billboard Controller	Receives API updates and schedules ad displays accordingly.
Monitoring & Feedback Loop	Tracks scraping success, data quality and billboard performance, feeding data back to improve AI models continuously.

**Q:** What technologies do you recommend for each component?
**A:** Here is a technology recommendation for each system component based on current best practices and AI web scraping trends in 2025:

Component	Recommended Technologies	Notes
User Interface/API	Go with Gin or Fiber for RESTful API development; frontend with React or Vue.js	Go offers high performance and concurrency for backend APIs
Scraping Orchestrator	Go-based job scheduler (e.g., built-in goroutines with cron libraries) or Apache Airflow if needed	Lightweight Go schedulers for scraping orchestration
AI-Powered Scraper	Playwright-Go or Colly (Go scraping framework) with headless browsers	Go libraries for scraping, with Playwright-Go for JS-heavy sites
Proxy & Anti-Bot Handling	Integrate proxy services like Bright Data or Oxylabs with Go HTTP clients	Manage proxies and avoid bans using Go HTTP clients
Data Processing & Analytics	Primarily Go for data processing; use Python only for advanced ML with TensorFlow or scikit-learn if necessary	Go handles data pipelines efficiently; Python used sparingly for complex ML
Decision Engine	Implement in Go, leveraging lightweight ML libraries or rule-based logic	Go offers fast inference and easy deployment
API Endpoint	Same as User API: Go with Gin/Fiber	Consistent tech stack for API serving
Smart Billboard Controller	IoT platform with Go SDK support (e.g., AWS IoT, Azure IoT)	Go’s concurrency suits embedded and IoT control
Monitoring & Feedback	Prometheus + Grafana; use Go exporters and monitoring tools	Native Go support for monitoring and metrics

**Q:** What data structures do I need in each stage?
**A:** Here is a breakdown of the key data structures you will need at each stage of your AI agent system, prioritising Go-native structures and concurrency patterns:

1. User Interface/API Layer

Structs to represent user input parameters (e.g., number of eyeballs, product category, demographics).

JSON encoding/decoding for API request/response payloads.

2. Scraping Orchestrator

Slices ([]string) to hold URLs or scraping tasks queue.

Channels (chan) for concurrent task dispatch and result collection, enabling safe communication between goroutines.

Maps (map[string]bool) for tracking visited URLs or deduplication.

3. AI-Powered Scraper

Structs representing scraped data entities (e.g., user engagement metrics, ad timing info).

Buffers or byte slices ([]byte) for raw HTML/JSON response storage.

Concurrent-safe queues/channels to pipeline data between scraping and processing stages.

4. Data Processing & Analytics

Slices and maps for tabular data representation and aggregation (e.g., mapping time slots to engagement scores).

Custom structs for processed insights (e.g., peak time windows with metadata).

Use Go’s built-in concurrency primitives if parallel processing is needed.

5. Decision Engine

Structs or simple data types to represent decision rules or ML model inputs/outputs.

Possibly use arrays or slices for feature vectors if integrating ML models.

6. API Endpoint

Structs for response objects conveying recommended ad times.

JSON marshalling/unmarshalling for API communication.

7. Smart Billboard Controller

Lightweight structs for scheduling commands.

Queues or channels if handling asynchronous updates or retries.

8. Monitoring & Feedback Loop

Maps or structs to hold metrics and scraper health status.

Time-series data structures if integrating with Prometheus or similar.

This design leverages Go’s strong typing, concurrency primitives (goroutines, channels), and efficient data structures like slices and maps to handle scraping, processing and communication efficiently. For example, channels enable safe concurrent scraping and result aggregation as shown in . Structs provide clear data modelling throughout the pipeline.

**Q:** how does the system design flowchart look like?
**A:** Here is a clear flowchart description of your AI agent system design, synthesising best practices from modern web scraping architectures and AI integration:

User Input/API Layer

User submits parameters (eyeballs, product category, demographics) via API.

API validates and forwards request to the orchestrator.

Scraping Orchestrator

Receives scraping tasks based on user input.

Manages task scheduling, proxy rotation, and concurrency.

Dispatches scraping jobs to the AI-powered scraper.

AI-Powered Scraper

Uses headless browsers (Playwright-Go) and AI/ML techniques to extract dynamic, structured data from targeted websites.

Handles anti-bot measures and adapts to changing page structures.

Data Processing & Analytics

Cleans and normalises scraped data.

Applies statistical or ML models to identify peak ad engagement times based on parameters.

Decision Engine

Aggregates insights and determines the optimal time to display ads.

API Endpoint

Returns the recommended ad time to the external system.

Smart Billboard Controller

Receives timing updates via API.

Schedules ad display accordingly.

Monitoring & Feedback Loop

Continuously monitors scraping success, data quality, and billboard performance.

Feeds data back to improve scraping models and decision logic.

**Q:** monolith or microservice? MVC, MVVC or other (specify)?
**A:** For your AI agent system, a microservices architecture is strongly recommended over a monolith. This approach offers enhanced scalability, fault isolation, faster deployment cycles, and better alignment with agile and DevOps practices, which are critical for a complex, data-intensive system like yours.

Why Microservices?
Scalability: Each service (scraper, data processor, decision engine, API, billboard controller) can scale independently based on load, optimising resource use.

Fault Isolation: Failures in one service won’t bring down the entire system, improving reliability.

Agility: Teams can develop, test and deploy services independently, speeding innovation and maintenance.

Technology Flexibility: You can use Go for high-performance components and Python selectively for ML tasks without affecting the whole system.

Operational Efficiency: Easier to monitor, update and roll back individual services.

Architectural Pattern: MVC vs MVVM vs Others
For your system, MVC (Model-View-Controller) is suitable for the API and frontend layers, where:

Model manages data and business logic (e.g., user parameters, scraping results).

View handles user interface or API responses.

Controller processes inputs, orchestrates services, and routes data.

For internal microservices, a strict UI pattern like MVC or MVVM is less relevant. Instead, focus on:

Domain-Driven Design (DDD): Each microservice encapsulates a specific domain (scraping, analytics, decision-making).

Event-Driven Architecture: Services communicate asynchronously via events or message queues for loose coupling and resilience.

Summary
Aspect	Recommendation	Reason
Architecture	Microservices	Scalability, fault isolation, agility, technology flexibility
API & Frontend	MVC	Clear separation of concerns for user interaction and API handling
Internal Services	Domain-Driven Design + Event-Driven	Modular, loosely coupled, scalable, and maintainable microservices

**Q:** Let's build each component, shall we? Where do you want to begin?
**A:** Great! Starting with building the system step-by-step is a solid approach. Given the complexity and foundational nature of the components, I suggest we begin with the Scraping Orchestrator and AI-Powered Scraper components first. This is because:

The scraper is the core data source for the entire system.

Getting the scraping logic and concurrency right early sets a strong foundation.

We can build a simple orchestrator to manage scraping tasks and scale it later.

We can start by setting up a Go-based concurrent web scraper using libraries like Colly or Playwright-Go, leveraging goroutines and channels for concurrency and proxy management. Once we have a working scraper prototype, we can build the orchestrator around it to schedule and manage scraping jobs efficiently.
